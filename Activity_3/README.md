# Activity 3.

## Step 1: Extraction of data.

In this activity we work with the data which belongs to Iquitos since 2008 to 2010, obtained from the activity 1. 
As in the activity 1, we don't use the first 4 columns.   

After load data the first step is remove outliers and then normalize 
the data set using the MinMaxScaler 
function in order to work with it.  
  
Then we execute PCA to visualize our data.
